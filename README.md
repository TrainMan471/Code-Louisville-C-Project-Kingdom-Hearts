# Code-Louisville-C-Project-Kingdom-Hearts
A C# Project for Code Louisville that displays the games in the Kingdom Heart series and where people can input their opinions about each select entry.

UPDATE: As of right now, all of the href links work except one, and that is the "Kingdom Hearts Application" link in the navigation bar on the "Index.cshtml" page.

I used the demo shown to us in class about using MVC and Entity Framework together as a basis for my project - I have added more views, added more methods in the controller, added my own custom css styling, and added more entries to be made into the database and will continue to keep updating in the future. I did this going back and watching the Treehouse videos.

As of right now, the project works, but the code needs refactoring in some places and some lines of code are never actually used.
