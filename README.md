# Code-Louisville-C-Project-Kingdom-Hearts
A C# Project for Code Louisville that displays the games in the Kingdom Heart series and where people can input their opinions about each select entry.

UPDATE: As of right now, all of the href links work except one, and that is the "Kingdom Hearts Application" link in the navigation bar on almost all the pages. There are other links to other pages on the website so this isn't too much of a problem.

I used the demo shown to us in class about using MVC and Entity Framework together as a basis for my project - I have added more views, added more methods in the controller, added my own custom css styling, and added more entries to be made into the database and will continue to keep updating in the future. I did this going back and watching the Treehouse videos.

Added a css file into a folder called Styles, before realizing that all css files were in the "Content" folder.

As of right now, the project works, but the code needs refactoring in some places and some lines of code are never actually used.

I Had a lot of fun making this project!
